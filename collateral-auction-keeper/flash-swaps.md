# Collateral Auction Flash Swaps

## Overview

Normally, the collateral auction-keeper uses RAI to bid on fixed discount collateral auctions. A keeper operator must acquire RAI and also maintain a RAI balance in the collateral keeper to be prepared for future collateral auctions. With collateral auction flash swaps, this is no longer necessary.

The auction-keeper can be configured to use Uniswap flash swaps when bidding on collateral auctions. This allows the keeper to participate in collateral auctions with no upfront capital\(ether or RAI\) other than gas costs.

## Details

The collateral auction-keeper performs flash swaps with a single tx through the [geb-keeper-flash-proxy](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-keeper-flash-proxy) contract.

The _geb-keeper-flash-proxy_ is used by _auction-keeper_ to:

1\) liquidate a critical SAFE\(starting an auction\) and bid on the _new_ auction by calling `liquidateAndSettleSAFE` on _geb-keeper-flash-proxy_

or

2\) bid on _existing_ auctions by calling `settleAuction` on _geb-keeper-flash-proxy_

See details of these functions in the [_geb-keeper-flash-proxy_ source code](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-keeper-flash-proxy/blob/master/src/GebUniswapV2KeeperFlashProxyETH.sol)

## Configuration

How to enable Use `--flash-swaps` flag when starting a collateral auction-keeper

## Flash Swaps in Action

Below is log output from _auction\_keeper_ started with the `--flash-swap` option

First, the _auction-keeper_ finds a critical SAFE and calls `liquidateAndSettleSAFE` on _geb-keeper-flash-proxy_.

The _auction-keeper_ then detects two existing auctions and calls `settleAuction` on _geb-keeper-flash-proxy_ for each one.

## Caveats

* Flash swaps are only supported for collateral auctions.
* _auction-keeper_ will not do flash swaps on critical SAFEs with saviours. [Read more about saviours](https://docs.reflexer.finance/integrations/safe-insurance)

## Possible errors

`GebUniswapV2KeeperFlashProxyETH/profit-not-enough-to-repay-the-flashswap`

If this happens, the current system market price is too high in relation to the redemption price and repaying the swap will not yield a profit. Also, the swap itself will move the system market price up. Thus, this error can occur if there is not enough liquidity in the Uniswap pool to support this flash swap. In either case, the auction-keeper can be restarted without `--flash-swap` to bid normally with the keeperâ€™s system coin.
